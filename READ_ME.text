# 🪂 PUBG Scout Terminal: Tactical Combatant Classification

## 🚀 Business Problem
In the competitive e-sports landscape, identifying "Pro-level" talent from massive telemetry datasets is a high-stakes challenge. This project implements a **Logistic Regression** classification engine to automate the scouting process, transforming raw match statistics into a binary "Pro" vs. "Amateur" verdict with a calculated confidence score.

## 🧠 Technical Architecture
The system utilizes a supervised learning pipeline designed for high-speed inference on combat telemetry data.

### 1. High-Dimensional Feature Engineering
The model processes an 8-dimensional feature vector to capture a holistic player profile:
* **Combat:** `Kills`, `Damage`, `Headshots` (Offensive efficiency)
* **Support:** `Revives`, `Heals` (Team utility)
* **Movement/Survival:** `Distance`, `Boosts` (Map control)
* **Looting:** `Weapons` (Resource management)

### 2. Engineering Decisions: Feature Scaling
* **Challenge:** Feature magnitudes vary significantly (e.g., `Distance` is measured in thousands, while `Revives` are single digits).
* **Solution:** Implemented `StandardScaler` (Z-score normalization).
* **Justification:** Logistic Regression uses a sigmoid function sensitive to feature scale. Without normalization, high-magnitude features like `Distance` would disproportionately dominate the model's weights, leading to biased classifications.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tooling
* **Language:** Python 3.14
* **ML Engine:** Scikit-Learn (Logistic Regression)
* **Data Science:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Deployment:** Streamlit (Custom Tactical UI with CSS Injection)
* **Serialization:** Joblib (Binary Model/Scaler Persistence)
